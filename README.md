# Dash Example 

Data visualization is a main component when you work as a data scientist. There are many tools to display your charts, but there is one very common tool called Dash. 

Dash is built by plotly, the same library widely used by data scientists. You can create a beautiful and robust Dashboard with Dash, using python.. With Dash apps, data scientists and engineers put complex Python analytics in the hands of business decision-makers and operators.

In this example you can see a simple dashboard with Dash using dash-boostrap, panda, numpy and plotly and you can run it with docker locally and you can deploy to GCP or other cloud platform.
